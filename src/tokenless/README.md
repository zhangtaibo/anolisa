# Token-Less

**LLM token optimization toolkit** — schema/response compression + command rewriting + tool environment readiness.

Token-Less combines complementary strategies to minimize LLM token consumption:

- **Schema & Response Compression** — Compresses OpenAI Function Calling tool definitions and API responses via the `tokenless-schema` library, cutting structural overhead before tokens ever reach the context window.
- **TOON Context Compression** — Encodes JSON responses to TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format via the `toon` binary, reducing token usage by 15-40% for structured data.
- **Command Rewriting** — Integrates [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) to filter and rewrite CLI command output, eliminating noise that would otherwise waste 60–90% of tokens.
- **Tool Ready** — Pre-checks tool execution environments (binaries, configs, permissions, network), auto-fixes missing dependencies, and classifies execution failures as environment issues vs logic errors — reducing wasted retry tokens.

Three integration paths are available:

- **OpenClaw plugin** — covers command rewriting, response compression, and schema compression in one plugin.
- **copilot-shell hook** — intercepts Shell commands via a PreToolUse hook and delegates to RTK for command rewriting + output filtering.
- **Hermes Agent plugin** — response compression, TOON encoding, command rewriting (block + suggest), and Tool Ready environment pre-check via Hermes's native plugin system.
- **Qoder CLI plugin** — Tool Ready, command rewriting, and response compression via Qoder's native hook system.
- **Claude Code plugin** — RTK command rewriting, response/TOON compression, and Tool Ready via Claude Code's official plugin marketplace.
- **Codex plugin** — response compression, TOON encoding, Tool Ready, and command rewriting via Codex's native hook system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repo (no submodules needed)
git clone <repo-url>
cd Token-Less

# Full setup: build + install binaries + deploy all adapters
make setup
```

Both methods install `tokenless` to `~/.local/bin`, helper binaries `rtk`/`toon` alongside it, and deploy the adapters (hooks + OpenClaw plugin + Hermes plugin).

## CLI Usage

### compress-schema

Compress a single tool schema:

```bash
# From file
tokenless compress-schema -f tool.json

# From stdin
cat tool.json | tokenless compress-schema
```

Compress a batch of tools (JSON array):

```bash
tokenless compress-schema -f tools.json --batch
```

### compress-response

Compress an API response:

```bash
# From file
tokenless compress-response -f response.json

# From stdin
curl -s https://api.example.com/data | tokenless compress-response
```

### compress-toon / decompress-toon

Encode JSON to TOON format (or decode back to JSON):

```bash
# Encode JSON to TOON
echo '{"name":"Alice","age":30}' | tokenless compress-toon
# name: Alice
# age: 30

# Decode TOON back to JSON
echo 'name: Alice\nage: 30' | tokenless decompress-toon
# {"name":"Alice","age":30}
```

## copilot-shell Hooks

The adapter provides hooks that are auto-discovered by copilot-shell via the cosh extension manifest:

| Hook | Event | File | Description |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| Tool environment check | PreToolUse (all tools) | `tool_ready_hook.sh` | Pre-check env, auto-fix, skip-retry guidance |
| Command rewriting | PreToolUse (Shell) | `rewrite_hook.py` | Rewrite commands via RTK |
| Response compression + attribution + TOON | PostToolUse | `compress_response_hook.py` | Compress + env error attribution + TOON |
| Schema compression | BeforeModel | `compress_schema_hook.py` | Compress tool schemas |

### Install

```bash
make cosh-extension-install
```

Hooks are registered via the cosh extension manifest (`cosh-extension.json`) and auto-discovered by copilot-shell — no manual `settings.json` configuration needed.
OpenClaw and Hermes plugin registration is handled by anolisa-cli using the component contract.

## Tool Ready

Tool Ready prevents wasted LLM tokens from retrying commands that fail due to missing environment dependencies.

**How it works**: Before each tool call, the `tool_ready_hook.sh` hook checks the tool's dependency list (from `tool-ready-spec.json`). If dependencies are missing, it reports `NOT_READY` with "Skip retry" guidance so the LLM doesn't waste tokens retrying a command that can't succeed. After a tool call fails, the compression hook classifies the error (missing binary, permissions, network, etc.) and injects attribution context.

### env-check CLI

```bash
# Check a specific tool
tokenless env-check --tool Shell

# Check all tools
tokenless env-check --all

# Generate checklist
tokenless env-check --checklist

# Check and auto-fix missing deps
tokenless env-check --tool Shell --fix
```

### Configuration

Per-tool dependencies are declared in `tool-ready-spec.json` (shipped within the adapter bundle at `common/tool-ready-spec.json`):

```json
{
  "Shell": {
    "required": [
      { "binary": "jq", "package": "jq", "manager": "apt" }
    ],
    "recommended": [
      { "binary": "rtk", "version": ">=0.35", "package": "rtk", "manager": "cargo",
        "fallback": [
          { "method": "symlink", "binary": "rtk", "source": "/usr/libexec/anolisa/tokenless/rtk" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

String format `"jq"` is also supported (auto-converts to object).

## OpenClaw Plugin

The plugin hooks into the OpenClaw agent loop at two stages:

| Hook | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Command rewriting | `before_tool_call` | Rewrites `exec` commands to RTK equivalents for filtered output | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `tool_result_persist` | Compresses tool results before they enter the context window | ✅ Active |
| Schema compression | — | Not supported by OpenClaw's hook system | ⏳ → ✅ |

**Response compression details:**
- Automatically compresses results from all tool types (`web_search`, `web_fetch`, `read_file`, etc.)
- Skips `exec` tool results when RTK is enabled — RTK already produces optimized output, avoiding double-compression
- Observed savings: **~78%** on `web_fetch` results, varies by content type

Each hook degrades gracefully — if the corresponding binary (`rtk` or `tokenless`) is not installed, that hook is silently skipped.

### Configuration

Options in `openclaw.plugin.json`:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `rtk_enabled` | `true` | Enable RTK command rewriting |
| `schema_compression_enabled` | `true` | Enable tool schema compression (pending OpenClaw support) |
| `response_compression_enabled` | `true` | Enable tool response compression via `tool_result_persist` |
| `verbose` | `true` | Log detailed rewrite/compression info |

## Hermes Agent Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at three Hermes events, covering five strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `pre_tool_call` | Environment readiness pre-check with auto-fix and skip-retry feedback | ✅ Active |
| Command rewriting | `pre_tool_call` | Blocks original command, suggests `rtk`-rewritten version (one extra round-trip) | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `transform_tool_result` | Compresses tool results via `tokenless compress-response` | ✅ Active |
| TOON encoding | `transform_tool_result` | Pipeline step after response compression — encodes JSON to TOON format | ✅ Active |
| Session tracking | `on_session_start` | Propagates agent/session IDs for stats recording | ✅ Active |
| Schema compression | — | Not supported by Hermes hook system (no hook exposes tool schemas) | ⏳ Blocked |

**How command rewriting works in Hermes**: Hermes's `pre_tool_call` hook can only block tool execution (not modify arguments), so the plugin blocks the original shell command and returns a message suggesting the RTK-rewritten version. The agent then re-executes with the optimized command, adding one extra tool-call round-trip. This is safe — `rtk rewrite` only does text substitution and never executes the command.

Each hook degrades gracefully — if the corresponding binary is not installed, that hook is silently skipped.

### Install

```bash
anolisa component install tokenless --framework hermes
```

Enable the plugin:

```bash
hermes plugins enable tokenless
```

Or add to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - tokenless
```

## Qoder CLI Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at three Qoder events, covering three strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `PreToolUse` | Environment readiness pre-check with auto-fix and skip-retry feedback | ✅ Active |
| Command rewriting | `PreToolUse` | Rewrites shell commands via RTK for token savings | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `PostToolUse` | Compresses tool responses and encodes to TOON format | ✅ Active |

Each hook degrades gracefully — if the corresponding binary is not installed, that hook is silently skipped.

### Install

```bash
make qoder-install
```

## Claude Code Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at two Claude Code events, covering four strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Ready | `PreToolUse` | Environment readiness pre-check with auto-fix and skip-retry feedback | ✅ Active |
| Command rewriting | `PreToolUse` (Bash) | Rewrites shell commands via RTK for token savings | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `PostToolUse` | Compresses tool responses and encodes to TOON format | ✅ Active |
| TOON encoding | `PostToolUse` | Pipeline step after response compression — encodes JSON to TOON format | ✅ Active |

Claude Code v2 requires plugins to be sourced from a registered marketplace. We expose the adapter's `claude-code/` directory as a single-plugin marketplace (`anolisa`), then install `tokenless@anolisa` from it.

### Install

```bash
make claude-code-install
```

## Codex Plugin

The plugin registers hooks at four Codex events, covering four strategies:

| Strategy | Event | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session check | `SessionStart` | Verifies tokenless CLI is installed and functional (non-blocking) | ✅ Active |
| Tool Ready | `PreToolUse` | Environment readiness pre-check with auto-fix and skip-retry feedback | ✅ Active |
| Command rewriting | `PreToolUse` | Rewrites shell commands via RTK for token savings | ✅ Active |
| Response compression | `PostToolUse` | Compresses tool responses and encodes to TOON format, injects compressed summary as `additionalContext` | ✅ Active |

> **Codex Protocol Constraint**: PostToolUse hooks cannot suppress the original tool output. The plugin injects a compressed *summary* as `additionalContext` — the model sees both the original output and the compressed summary.

### Install

```bash
make codex-install
```
